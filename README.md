# Street Fighter II Reinforcement Learning Agent

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent trained to play **Street Fighter II** using the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm. The environment is built using [Gym-Retro](https://github.com/openai/retro), and training is done using [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

---

## Project Overview

- **Game**: Street Fighter II (Champion Edition)
- **AI Approach**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Environment**: Gym-Retro with custom wrappers
- **Goal**: Train an AI agent to defeat a fixed in-game AI opponent by learning optimal strategies through trial-and-error

---

## Reinforcement Learning Setup

- **Algorithm**: PPO (Stable-Baselines3)
- **Observation Space**: Downsampled game frames or custom game-specific features
- **Action Space**: Reduced set of meaningful actions (e.g., punch, kick, block, move)
- **Reward Function**:
  - +1 for dealing damage
  - -1 for taking damage
  - +10 for winning a round
  - -10 for losing a round
  - Small penalty for idle time

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ijlal-123/StreetFighter.git
cd StreetFighter
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Gym-Retro and Setup the Game ROM

```bash
pip install gym-retro
python -m retro.import ./roms/
```

## Running the Agent

### Train the PPO Agent
  Run on terminal after opening the root folder:
```bash
pyhton sf2_env.py
python train.py
python play.py 
```


## ðŸ“Š Results

After training for several million steps, the agent achieved:

- **~80% win rate** against the fixed AI
- Learned to block attacks, combo moves, and trap the opponent
- Real-time decision making within frame limits
